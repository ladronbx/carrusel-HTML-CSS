# Interactive Carousel ðŸš€

 Here you can see the interactive carousel in action : [Interactive carousel](https://ladronbx.github.io/carrusel-HTML-CSS/) 

This project features an image carousel developed using `HTML` and `CSS`. **The carousel displays a series of images in a horizontal layout, allowing users to explore different categories of content interactively.**

The carousel is built using semantic `HTML` tags for a clear and accessible structure. Each image is wrapped in an `<img>` tag with a descriptive "alt" attribute to enhance accessibility and the user experience.

The visual design of the carousel is managed through custom `CSS` styles. The images are presented in a section with a dark background **(#1c1c1c)** to create an appealing contrast. Each image initially appears with reduced opacity and a 90% grayscale effect to highlight interactivity.

**As users hover over the images, they respond with a smooth transition. The image under the cursor enlarges and displays in its original colors, creating an additional contrast effect by adjusting the contrast filter to 110%.**

This image carousel is an excellent way to visually present various content categories while maintaining a **simple yet engaging interaction**. The source code provided in this repository allows you to understand how this functionality and animation are achieved using `HTML` and `CSS`.

Feel free to explore the images and customize the code to suit your own needs. I hope this image carousel adds a visually appealing touch to your website or project.
